DARKNET

Definitions
Darknet: ...

People hide themselves behind anonymous to commit very bad things (murders, drugs traffic, ...).

Most things have two sides: Good & Bad.

3D Printing

* Some people use 3D printing to have an unknown fire weapon
* Others use 3D printing to replace a lost arm at low cost (because the traditional operation is quite expensive - cost?)

What is the good in anonymous ?

* The right for privacy: I don't want everybody know everything on my life, weither these things are good or bad
* In totalitarism contries, it's good that people can freely express their feelings - 
And we can't be 100% sure that our current democratic contry will stay this way forever (more & more information are collected on us)
* We should be able to express what we really feel without fear - To be ourselves - And without arm others
* Progress is possible when we make something in a wrong way, then learn from our mistakes
* Lack of freedom supress imagination, creativity and evolution
