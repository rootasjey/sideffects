Probably the most climate change denier

> There're some people who are so arogant to think that they're so powerful, they can change climate. Men can't change climate.

[CHART GLOBAL WARMING INFLUENCE BY COUNTRY]

##CHINA
China, the manufacturer of the world, has begun its transition to renewable energy. A part of the population wears health mask.

##INDIA
300.000 million people without power.
That's equivalent to the entire population of the United States.

About 30% of households in India are yet to have access to electricity

3rd or 4th largest reservoir o coal in the world

##KIRIBATI
Weather damages

>What we've done to the rest of the world is just criminal.
>It's not just see level rise. We've taken the ecosystem that used to be inhabited by an incredibly number of fishes and we've knocked the whole system down, reversing half a billion years in evolution.
>On billion people depends on fishery and coral.


----------
##IN TH LAST 30 YEARS,

#**50% OF ALL CORAL**

##HAS BEEN LOST.

----------

The oceans are like a big buffer because they absorb CO2. 
They take of about 1/3 of the CO2 in the atmosphere.
They are a stabilizing force in climate.

The problem is the oceans can't do their job fast enough with this much rate of carbon dioxygen.

>There will always be life in the oceans, but it's not going to be necessarily the kind of life we want.

We're taking away the ecosystem that normally help us to re-stabilize the planet. 
Like oceans, grand forests absorb carbon from our atmosphere.

FOREST [IF ALIVE]

##INDONESIA
Large firms are destroying the forest for **PALM OIL** to produce food and cosmetics.

* BURGER KING
* TYSON
* WALGREENS
* DORITOS
* PEPSICO
* CUP NOODLES
* QUAKER
* KRAFTHEINZ
* SMART ONES
* SARALEE
* KRAFT - MACARONI & CHEESE

The expansion of palm oil industry in Indonesia has taken over about 80% of the forests.

Indonesia is one of the most corrupt countries in the world.
Companies bribe government officials to issue a permit for them to start burning the land.

##In 2015 when the forest fire happens in Indonesia, it emits **more carbon daily than the entire U.S. economy.**
Not only livelihood of the people are in danger, but also the life of the forest species.

>And the reason people are chopping out the forest is because people keep buying stuff.

>People have to realize that what they do in their supermarket, the decisions they make in their daily lives, are affecting places in the ecosystem.

##Of all the reasons of the deforestation, foremost is **BEEF**. 
BEEF is one of the most inefficient uses of resources on the planet.

#**47%** OF LANDS USED FOR FOOD PRODUCTION
From that number,

* 70% is used as feed for cattle
* 1% fruit, vegetables, nuts (that we actually eat)

Most importantly cows produce **methane**, and methane is a powerful Greenhouse gas.

The way cows produce methane is they eat as much as they can. And when they're chewing a whole bunch of methane is burp through the mouth into the atmosphere.


----------

###METHANE IS FAR MORE IMPACTFUL
##EVERY MOLECULE OF METHANE (CH4) IS **EQUIVALENT OF 23 MOLECULES OF CO2**

----------

12% of U.S.' emissions is due to beef.

###1/2 lb. Burger

* = 200 hours of 60w lightbulb use 
* = 24 hours of window air conditioner use
* = 42 miles of driving a Prius

##CARBON TAX
A tax on any kind of activity that put carbon on the atmosphere.
>When you taxe something raise the price, people tend to consume less of it. 

>Politicians don't always do what professors want them to do
>- Gregory Mankiw


----------

####BY 2060, CLIMATE CHANGE WILL COST TAXPAYERS AN ESTIMATED
#$44 TRILLION USD

----------

Adding a carbon doesn't necessarily add more taxes as you can turn around and cut others taxes in response.

For example, reducing payroll tax to increase carbon tax.

So it's more a tax shift rather than a tax increase.

How to put a carbon tax in place in the U.S.?
You'll have to convince the population first.

>Politicians do what the people want them to do.
(cf. Obama against gay marriages)

##GERMANY
30% of electricity come from solar & wind.

##SWEDEN
>Sweden Boosts Renewables to Become First Fossil-Fuel-Free Nation
>- Bloomberg, September 16, 2015


----------


>Now, if this was a movie we could write the end of this script, or figure a way out of this mess. But real life doesn't work like that. And we can't pretend we know how this gonna end.


----------

>The only thing that we can do is control what we do next. How we live our lives. What we consume. How we get involve. And how we use our vote to tell our leaders that we know the truth about climate change.

----------
##The question is: Can we change our course in time?
